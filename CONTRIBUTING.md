## Initialize your code

1. If you don't have `Poetry` install it:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

3. Initialize poetry and install `pre-commit` hooks:

```bash
make install
make pre-commit-install
```

4. Run the codestyle:

```bash
make codestyle
```

## Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/bitnulleins/rivermoe/blob/master/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black` and `darglint` library

Update all dev libraries to the latest version using one comand

```bash
make update-dev-deps
```

<details>
<summary>4. Code security</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Type checks</summary>
<p>

Run `mypy` static type checker

```bash
make mypy
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to ~~rule~~ run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/bitnulleins/rivermoe/tree/master/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files

```bash
make dsstore-remove
```

Remove .mypycache

```bash
make mypycache-remove
```

Or to remove all above run:

```bash
make cleanup
```

</p>
</details>

## Building and releasing package

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish 🙂 `poetry publish --build`

## Dependencies

We use `poetry` to manage the [dependencies](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).
If you dont have `poetry`, you should install with `make poetry-download`.

To install dependencies and prepare [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks you would need to run `install` command:

```bash
make install
make pre-commit-install
```

To activate your `virtualenv` run `poetry shell`.

## Codestyle

After installation you may execute code formatting.

```bash
make codestyle
```

### Checks

Many checks are configured for this project. Command `make check-codestyle` will check black, isort and darglint.
The `make check-safety` command will look at the security of your code.

Comand `make lint` applies all checks.

### Before submitting

Before submitting your code please do the following steps:

1. Add any changes you want
1. Add tests for the new changes
1. Edit documentation if you have changed something significant
1. Run `make codestyle` to format your changes.
1. Run `make lint` to ensure that types, security and docstrings are okay.
